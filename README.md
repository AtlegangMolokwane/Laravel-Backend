# Laravel-Backend

## My apologies for not putting the backend and front end in the same repo

## Run script
- run "php artisan serve"

## database
- I connected my laravel to my postgresql database, I am no sure how you will connect to it or get the data. Please in-form me if there is something I have to do for you to get the connection.
